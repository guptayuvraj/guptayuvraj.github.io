ScaleIO ECS is a software-only solution that uses application hosts’ local disks.

Features:

* **Simplified operation**- ECS enables IT administrator to manage the entire data center stack.

* **Avoid capacity planning**- ECS is elastic, enabling you to add, move, remove servers and capacity during I/O operations.

* **Self-healing**- It rebalances whenever capacity and/or servers are added.

* **Dynamic performance allocation**- It provides dynamic allocation based on applications’ needs.

* **Freedom of choice through hardware vendor lock-in elimination.**
